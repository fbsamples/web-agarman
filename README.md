# Agar Man

A fast-paced word game for Facebook canvas. Choose a difficulty and a time limit, then use the letters to make words - more points for rarer letters, and bonus points for longer words.

Authors: Colin Creitz

## Demo

https://apps.facebook.com/agarman

## Installing

To run the code yourself, please create a Facebook application. The file `config/php` points to several required resources that you should configure (a MySQL or compatible PDO DB, and a Memcache pool); `main.sql` contains code to initialize the DB, which you should run before accessing the app.

## Additional Resources

 * The app demonstrates several platform features, all tagged so they can be found easily in the code. Search for:
   * `TAG:AUTH` to see how to implement Facebook authentication
   * `TAG:REQUESTS` as an example of creating and managing requests
   * `TAG:FEED` to see how to use the Feed dialog
   * `TAG:PAYMENTS` for a sample implementation of Facebook Payments
   * `TAG:OFFERS` to learn about letting users earn your game's virtual currency
   * `TAG:ACHIEVEMENTS` and `TAG:SCORES`  for those APIs
 * The repo contains a Keynote slide deck from the Facebook World Hack based on Agar Man, WorldHackGames.key
 * You can see any errors Facebook returns by appending a "debug=1" to the url of the app.
